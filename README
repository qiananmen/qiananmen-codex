# Report of My Sharing DuckDuckGo Activity

## How did you get your friend to switch to DuckDuckGo?

I discovered an immutable law that rules the universe. DuckDuckGo Law. In brief, those who love birds are inclined to chose DuckDuckGo. Testing is absolutely easy. Just ask one whether he is fond of birds. Any birds, a blue jay, a cardinal or an oriole. When you get an affirmative answer, he is a duckducker or a potential duckducker. It seems quite normal, considering there is no dove-friendly search engine other than DuckDuckGo.

It is also important to draw up a list that reasons. [Why I love DuckDuckGo?](https://github.com/qiananmen/qiananmen-codex/tree/1f87438)
